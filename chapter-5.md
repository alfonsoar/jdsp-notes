# Chapter 5

Chapter 5 starts off by cataloging the importance of being able to decouple JS applications and the concept of "modules". In the past modules (ie. packages like `react`, `jQuery`, `bootstrap`) in javascript did not have a single standard which led to the creation of Asynchronous Module Definition (AMD) and CommonJS. Eventually the governing body for JavaScript, TC39 introduced "ECMAScript modules" (ES Modules) with ES2015 specification. Since then these have become the defacto way of importing / exporting in JavaScript applications and is supported by all major browsers.
